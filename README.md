# AI Arcade

A web-based arcade featuring classic games with an AI twist. Players can challenge themselves against our trained models, or compete against friends to see who's the ultimate champion.

## Features
- A curated selection of 10 classic arcade games, including Tetris, Pong, Snake, and more
- Each game has been enhanced with AI-powered opponents that adapt to your playstyle
- Mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go gaming
- Customizable controls for each game, tailored to the player's preferences

## Technologies Used
- HTML5/CSS3 for a responsive and modern UI
- JavaScript for dynamic gameplay and AI interactions
- WebSockets for real-time communication between client and server
- Node.js/Express.js for server-side logic and data management

## How it Works
1. The player selects a game to play from the arcade menu.
2. The game is loaded into an iframe, where the AI-powered opponent awaits.
3. The player interacts with the game using custom controls, which are sent to the server via WebSockets.
4. The server processes the player's input and updates the game state accordingly.
5. The updated game state is then sent back to the client, where it is rendered in real-time.

## Future Development
- Integration of machine learning algorithms for more advanced AI opponents
- Support for additional classic games and genres
- Leaderboards and high-score tracking for competitive players
